# Lab assignments for Introduction to Data-Centric AI

This repository contains my solutions to the lab assignments for the [Introduction to
Data-Centric AI](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/) class.

## [Lab 1: Data-Centric AI vs. Model-Centric AI][lab-1]

The [first lab assignment][lab-1] walks you through an ML task of building a
text classifier, and illustrates the power (and often simplicity) of
data-centric approaches.
