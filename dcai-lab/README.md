# Lab assignments for Introduction to Data-Centric AI

This repository contains my solutions to the lab assignments for the [Introduction to
Data-Centric AI](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/) class.

## Lab 1: Data-Centric AI vs. Model-Centric AI

The [first lab assignment](https://github.com/hazrulakmal/deep-learning/tree/main/dcai-lab/1.%20data-centric-model-centric) walks you through an ML task of building a text classifier, and illustrates the power (and often simplicity) of data-centric approaches.

# Lab 2: Label Errors

[This lab assignment]() guides you through writing your own implementation of
automatic label error identification using Confident Learning, the technique
taught in [todayâ€™s lecture][lec-2].

## Lab 3: Dataset Creation and Curation

[This lab assignment]() is to analyze an already collected dataset labeled by multiple annotators.

## Lab 4: Data-centric Evaluation of ML Models

[This lab assignment]() is to try improving the performance of a given
model solely by improving its training data via some of the various strategies
covered here.
